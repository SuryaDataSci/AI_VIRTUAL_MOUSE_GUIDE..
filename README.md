# AI_VIRTUAL_MOUSE_GUIDE..
Use hand gestures to move the mouse, click, scroll, and perform right-click actions.

🔥 Why This Project Stands Out?
✅ Solves a Real-World Problem – Hands-free control is useful for disabled users, gaming, and automation.
✅ Impressive Tech Stack – Uses Computer Vision (OpenCV), Hand Tracking (Mediapipe), and PyAutoGUI.
✅ AI-Driven – Incorporates deep learning-based hand landmark detection.
✅ Recognition-Worthy – Few students attempt real-time gesture-based interfaces, making your project unique.
✅ Extensible – You can add voice commands, eye-tracking, or ML-based gesture recognition later.

🚀 How This Helps in Data Science & AI?
🔹 Computer Vision Expertise – Practical experience in image processing.
🔹 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) – Bridges AI with real-world usability.
🔹 Gesture Recognition & AI Integration – Understanding ML-based pattern recognition.
🔹 Automation & Control – Connects AI with real-time physical system interactions.

💻 How It Works
The HandTrackingModule detects hand landmarks.
The Index Finger moves the mouse cursor.
A Pinch Gesture (Index & Middle Finger) triggers a mouse click.
Coordinates are mapped from the webcam feed to the screen dimensions.
🖥️ Usage Instructions
Move Mouse → Move your index finger in the air.
Left Click → Pinch index & middle finger together.

🎯 Future Improvements
🔹 Add Right Click Gesture
🔹 Implement Scrolling Feature
🔹 Add Drag and Drop Functionality
